This is the first website I did all by myself using React and Firebase.

If you're really committed to learning about this project you'll see a pretty big commit was made in early August, and many files changed pretty drastically. Here's why.

I first did this website using React and Node.js. React was ( and still is ) hosted on GitHub Pages, the Node.js part was hosted on Clever Cloud ( my database was also on Clever Cloud, it was a Postgresql database ) and files were on Amazon S3. When my Clever Cloud free trial expired I chose to move everything to Firebase, that I had learnt a few weeks prior on an online course.

This commit also kind of fixes the original file architecture/naming, and is the first commit that implements React Hooks. It made the code more readable and optimized.
